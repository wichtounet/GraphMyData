<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>
<p>GraphMyData is a tool to show different statistics between different
applications when doing a User Interface Evaluation by a person who does not
know an application. The row data entered at the left only means the time
(eg. in seconds or any unit that you want to use) needed to perform an action in
an application. This application handle onlycomparison of <strong>two
applications</strong>.</p>
<p>There can be a different amount of measures that can be done, eg. time needed to find the help, time
needed to find the way of printing, etc.</p>
<p>The application then show in real-time different statistics about the given results</p>
