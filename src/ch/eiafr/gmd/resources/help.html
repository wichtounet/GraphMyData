<h2>Introduction</h2>
</a>
<p>GraphMyData is a tool to show different statistics between different
applications when doing a User Interface Evaluation by a person who does not
know an application. The row data entered at the left only means the time
(eg. in seconds or any unit that you want to use) needed to perform an action in
an application. This application handle onlycomparison of <strong>two
applications</strong>.</p>
<p>There can be a different amount of measures that can be done, eg. time needed to find the help, time
needed to find the way of printing, etc.</p>
<p>The application then show in real-time different statistics about the given results</p>

<a name="general">
<h2>General presentation</h2>
<p>The application is separated into four different views that are presented below
The first one is the table view in which to put the measures. The view 2 is the
data view that shows some statistics. The view 3 shows a pie chart corresponding
to the data, and the view 4 shows an histogram.</p>

<p align="center">The 4 views of GraphMyData</p>
<p>You can find more information about these views in the sections below.</p>

<a name="table">
<h2>Table view</h2>
</a>
<p>
    This view displays the current data of the two applications. You can add a new data in this table using the
    add button or pressing the 'a' key when the focus is in the table. Then a view is made visible and you can add
    a new data. Fill the text fields, then press enter or use the OK button. <br />

    You can also edit the data in the table by double clicking the data and then edit the value.
</p>
<a name="data">
<h2>Data view</h2>
</a>
<p>
    This view display some stats about the current data. It displays the application who's the best and the mean,
    max, and min of the two applications.
</p>
<a name="pie">
<h2>Pie chart view</h2>
</a>
<p>The pie charts show us a proportion of values in three different range: 
smaller than 10 (yellow), between 10 and 25 (blue) and finally bigger than 25 (green). 
There is one Pie chart for each application. </p>

<a name="histo">
<h2>Histogram view</h2>
</a>
<p>The histogram view simply shows the data like they are put in the table, in
a more visual form. The two bars (blue and red) represent the value of the
measures for application 1, resp. application 2. The groups of bars are put
in the same order as the one in the table view.</p>
